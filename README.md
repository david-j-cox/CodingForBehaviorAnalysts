# Coding for Behavior Analysts
## David J. Cox, PhD, MSB, BCBA-D


This book is the companion text for the graduate course titled "Coding for Behavior Analysts". The course is an introduction to programming in Python for behavior analysts interested in adding coding to their repertoire. It was designed to follow a 12-week format wherein students meet once per week for approximately 3 hours. The associated syllabus can be found [link to be added]. 

Why Python? Two reasons. First, Python is my favorite. And, since I'm writing the book, I get to use my favortie language. Second, and more importantly, Python is professionally functional for the students likely to be interested in this course. Python allows a behavior analyst to go end-to-end in the research pipeline while using a single language. That is, using Python, a behavior analyst can build out an entire experiment, design the database architecture, deploy the experiment to a computer or online, collect data, analyze and visualize the data, write a research report, and publish the report online. There are other programming languages that allow researchers to accomplish these same tasks. However, at the time of this writing (2020), Python also has the benefit of being free with a large developing community and a syntax that is relatively easy to read and learn. All-in-all, Python is a great introduction to coding for behavior analysts.
